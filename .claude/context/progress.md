# Project Progress

## Current Status

### Repository State
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Repository**: https://github.com/guillaumejay/resas.git
- **Git Status**: Clean working directory with untracked files
- **Recent Commits**: 
  - `0c188e0` - Initial commit

### Untracked Files
- `.claude/` - Complete PM system infrastructure
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project rules and guidelines  
- `COMMANDS.md` - Command reference

### Immediate Status
- ✅ PM system fully scaffolded in `.claude/` directory
- ✅ Agent specifications complete (code-analyzer, file-analyzer, test-runner, parallel-worker)
- ✅ Command system implemented with full PM workflow
- ✅ Project documentation created (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, COMMANDS.md)
- ⏳ Context documentation being created (in progress)

## Recent Completed Work

### PM System Implementation
- Created complete agent infrastructure with 4 specialized agents
- Implemented comprehensive command system covering:
  - Context management (`/context:*`)
  - Project management (`/pm:*`) 
  - Testing workflow (`/testing:*`)
  - Utility commands (`/prompt`, `/re-init`, `/code-rabbit`)
- Established clear project rules and development guidelines

### Documentation
- Comprehensive agent documentation explaining context firewall patterns
- Complete command reference with usage examples
- Project-specific rules in CLAUDE.md following absolute development standards

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Complete Context Creation** - Finish creating all 9 context files
2. **Commit Initial State** - Add and commit all PM system files
3. **Project Initialization** - Use `/pm:init` to initialize the PM system
4. **Context Priming** - Use `/context:prime` to load context

## Work Queue

### High Priority
- Context documentation completion
- Initial commit of PM system
- Test PM system functionality

### Medium Priority  
- Validate all command functionality
- Test agent execution
- Documentation review

### Future Considerations
- Integration with external tools
- Custom command development
- PM system optimization

## Blockers & Issues

None currently identified.

## Development Environment

- **Platform**: Windows (win32)
- **Git Repository**: Initialized and connected to remote
- **PM System**: Fully implemented, not yet committed
- **Context System**: In progress

## Notes

- This is a Claude Code PM System project, not a traditional application
- Focus is on meta-development tooling for managing other projects
- All documentation must be in French per project requirements
- System ready for production use once context is complete
